# home
This is my personal home folder that I use on UNIX-based machines.
Having my home folder on GitHub allows me to setup a new machine faster and to be more robust in case I lose one of the existing machines.

## Why README.md is a link to .README.md?
I don't want to see a README.md file when launching `ls` from my home folder, but at the same time I want this presentation to be shown on the GitHub repository.
To obtain the aforementioned goal I:
* wrote the real markdown file as a hidden file
* added a symbolic link to the hidden markdown file
* added `README.md` to the `.gitignore` file
* run `git update-index --assume-unchanged README.md`
This allows me to safely delete the symbolic link from my machines without:
* interfering with the GitHub repository presentation
* having the deleted symbolic link appear when launching `git status`
* missing modifications to the hidden markdown file when launching `git status`

## Appearance
Once everything is setup correctly, this is the look of the command line when opening a new session:
